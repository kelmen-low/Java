11 minutes: Verbiage is different. I had to look at the original for Scanner and Random initialization

import java.util.Random;
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		//Prompt the user for a number
		System.out.println("Please pick a random number");
		System.out.println("The number should be 0, 1 or 2: ");

		//Prompt the number
		Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);
		int userGuess = scnr.nextInt();

		//Prompt the computer guess
		Random rand = new Random();
		int computerGuess = rand.nextInt(0,3);

		//Check if the numbers match
		if (userGuess == computerGuess) {
			System.out.println("Your guess was " + userGuess + "?!");
			System.out.println("Wow that was my guess!");
		} else {

			System.out.println("Argh! My guess was " + computerGuess + ".");
		}
		
	}
}

11 minutes: Didn't look at the original at all except for initializing rand = new Random();
